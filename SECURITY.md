## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this architecture seriously. If you discover a vulnerability (e.g., a prompt injection bypass or a regex failure), please follow these steps:

1.  **DO NOT** open a public issue.
2.  Email the maintainer directly at: **aneeshjoseph1091@gmail.com**
3.  Include a "Proof of Concept" payload that demonstrates the bypass.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide a timeline for the patch.
